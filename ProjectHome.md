RPC Command pattern API implementation which can be used on Android platform. The implementaion uses java binary serialization/deserialization so it is possible that it will not work with all the objects. This is reworked gwt-dispatch library which is detached from GWT RPC. Basic servlets and Java serialization is used instead of.

If you enjoyed gwt-dispatch and look something similiar for Android RPC implementation the http-dispatch should to satisfy your requirements.
